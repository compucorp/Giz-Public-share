# The Campaign Dashboard

Campaign Manager adds an extended campaign dashboard to CiviCRM.

![Campaign Dashboard](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.campaign/blob/screenshots/dashboard/dashboard_overview_bottom2.png?raw=true "The Campaign Dashboard")

Here you can find all relevant information for a specific campaign:

1. The campaign name
2. Its parent- and sub-campaigns
3. Buttons to
    - View the *Campaign Tree*, a visualization of the campaign relationships
    - Edit the current campaign
    - Create a sub-campaign of the current one
    - Clone the current campaign with or without all of its sub-campaigns (This
      keeps the relationship of all campaigns in a specific sub-tree and creates
      a copy of it.)
4. The quick information panel, that shows campaign status information, like
   - Campaign Status
   - Whether it is *active* or *disabled*
   - The external identifier
   - *Start-* and *end date* of the campaign
   - The revenue goal for this campaign
   - An "Apply to Subcampaigns"-Button (1), that applies the respective campaign
     attribute to **all sub-campaigns**. Be careful when using this as there is currently no option to reverse this operation. In case of doubt use the *Clone Tool* to create a copy of a campaign first. 
 
     1. ![Apply to Subcampaign](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.campaign/blob/screenshots/dashboard/dashboard_apply_to_sub.png?raw=true "\"Apply to Subcampaign\" example") 
   - The "Return to Dashboard"-Button that lets you return to the standard
     campaign dashboard of CiviCRM
5. The *Campaign Information*-Section (collapsed by default), that contains the
    - Campaign Description
    - Campaign Goals
6. The *Key Performance Indicator Charts*-Section, which shows visualizations
   for some KPIs
7. The *Key Performance Indicator*-Section 
8. The *Campaign Expense*-Section

## Campaign Tree

![Campaign Tree](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.campaign/blob/screenshots/tree/tree_view_overview.png?raw=true "Campaign Tree")

The Campaign Tree View is a visualization of the campaign hierarchy. It shows a
campaign and all of its sub-campaings as an interactive tree structure. This
view is zoomable, scrollable and supports drag-and-drop-editing of the tree.

- *Left-clicking* a node switches the tree view to the selected node
- *Left-clicking* a node **while dragging** enters the drag-and-drop mode. Drop
  the node on another one to make it a subcampaign of it. This also works with sub-trees. When selecting a sub-tree, *only the selected node* is visible, all other nodes are invisible until the operation is completed.
- *Dragging* while not clicking on a node will pan the currently visible tree.
- *Scrolling* in and out will zoom in or out of the tree view. 
- Use the *Reset View*-button to reset the view to the default settings. This does **not** affect the tree structure in any way. Therefore you can not use this to undo changes made to the tree.

### Tree Context Menu

- You can access a context menu with a *right-click* on a node in the tree view.
  This gives you the following options:

![Campaign Tree Context Menu](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.campaign/blob/screenshots/tree/tree_view_node.png?raw=true "Campaign Tree Context Menu")

### View Campaign

Use this option to quickly navigate to the dashboard of the selected campaign.

### Edit Campaign

Use this option to quickly navigate to the edit page of the selected campaign.

### Creating a subcampaign

Use this option to quickly create a new campaign that is a subcampaign of the
selected node.


## The Clone Tool
![The Clone Tool](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.campaign/blob/screenshots/clone_tool/clone_tool_overview.png?raw=true "The Clone Tool")

This tool enables you to quickly create copies of a single campaign or nested
campaigns.

- *Include subtree*: Enabling this checkbox will create a copy of the currently
  selected campaign including all subcampaigns of it. Disabling it will only
  clone the current campaign.
- *Title Match Pattern*: When cloning a subset of campaigns Campaign-Manager
  will scan the titles of all affected campaigns for this pattern and change all
  occurrences with the *Title Replacement Pattern*. 
	  - For example: The campaign "Holiday Campaign 2015" with a *Title Match
	    Pattern* "/2015/" and a *Title Replacement Pattern* "2016" will change the
	    Title of the clone to "Holiday Campaign 2016".
- *Start Date Offset*/*End Date Offset*: The start (or end-) date of all
  affected campaigns will be offset by this value.
	  - Other possible valid values are: "+5 weeks", "12 day", "-7 weekdays", but
	    it is recommended to use days.

## Key Performance Indicators

This list of default
[Key Performance Indicators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator)
contains the following values of the current campaign (and partially sub
campaigns):

![Campaign KPI](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.campaign/blob/screenshots/kpi/kpi.png?raw=true "The KPI Section")

* Total Revenue
* Total Revenue Goal
* Number of Contributions (completed)
* Average Amount of Contributions
* Number of Contributions (all but cancelled/failed)
* *Total Costs*: Sum of expenses connected with this campaign tree
* *Number of First Contributions*: Number of contributions of new donors
* Average Cost per First Contribution
* Average Cost per Second or Later Contribution
* *ROI*: [Return on investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment)
* *Total Revenue Reached*:  Revenue goal reached in percent

*For developers*: This list is extendable and can be fully customized by
implementing a civicrm hook explained in detail below.

### KPI Charts

![Campaign KPI Charts](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.campaign/blob/screenshots/kpi/kpi_charts.png?raw=true "The KPI Chart Section")

This section contains a subset of all available KPIs that are additionally
visualized to enable a quick overview of the campaign's status.

*For developers*: It is possible to change the behavior of this section (i.e.
adding and removing KPIs from it or change the type of visualization) by
implementing a civicrm hook explained in detail below.


## Campaign Expenses

![Campaign Expenses](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.campaign/blob/screenshots/expenses/expense_overview.png?raw=true "The Expense Section")

The campaign expenses interface shows all expenses associated to a specific
campaign. It allows you to add new expenses or edit/delete existing ones.

### Adding a new expense

To add a new expense click on the *Add Expense*-Button. The following dialog
will appear:

![Campaign Expense Dialog](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.campaign/blob/screenshots/expenses/expense_add_edit.png?raw=true "The Expense Dialog")

### Editing an expense

This works the same way as adding a new expense. Click on the *Edit*-Button of
an existing expense to open the dialog shown above.

### Deleting an expense

Click on the *Delete*-Button of an existing expense. A confirmation dialog will
appear:

![Campaign Expense Delete Dialog](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.campaign/blob/screenshots/expenses/expense_delete.png?raw=true "The Expense Delete Dialog")

Selecting *Continue* deletes the expense. This cannot be undone.

### Expense Categories

By default only the *default* category exists. If you need more that that add
more categories in CiviCRM via *Administer* → *System Settings* →
*Option Groups* → `campaign_expense_types`


## Development and support resources

The issue tracker for this project can be found
[here](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.campaign/issues).

### Implementing custom KPIs

As mentioned above you can add custom KPIs, edit or remove existing ones by
implementing the following hook:

`#!php hook_civicrm_campaignKpis ($campaign_id, &$kpi_array, $tree_level)`

The `$kpi_array` consists kpi-elements that follow this schema:

```PHP
$kpi_array["donation_heartbeat"] = array(
  "id" => "donation_heartbeat",
  "title" => "Donation Heartbeat",       // title shown in kpi list on the dashboard
  "kpi_type" => "hidden",                // "hidden", "money", "number" or "percentage"
  "vis_type" => "line_graph",            // "line_graph" or "pie_chart"
  "description" => "Donation Heartbeat", // short description, not used yet    
  "value" => $all_contribs,              // value(s) of this KPI
  "link" => ""                           // link to advanced description, not used yet
 );
```
