## What is CiviCRM EventsExtras Extension?

EventsExtras Extension provides a functionality to hide Events html fields on Manage Event including Event Info (New Event), Event Fee and Online Registration Pages. It also allows CiviCRM Administrators to set default (global) values for the fields that are hidden from pages.

When creating or updating CiviCRM Event pages, there are certain mandatory fields for which a value is required, for example, a Default Roles must be selected on the Event Info page in order to create a new Event. Ttherefore, if the Default Role field is hidden. the CiviCRM Administrator must always set the default global settings of Default Roles. 


## How do I get EventsExtras Extension?

Events Extras Extension is designed to work with CiviCRM 5.8 plus (it may work with previous versions of CiviCRM 5.x but it was not tested on CiviCRM versions less than CiviCRM 5.8) If you are on an earlier version of CiviCRM, you will need to upgrade your site first or contact info@compucorp.co.uk if you need assistance to do so.

If your CiviCRM is already on CiviCRM 5.8 plus and this is the first time you use an extension,  please see [here](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Extensions "CiviCRM Extensions Installation") for full instructions and information on how to install and configure extensions.
